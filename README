This is a timetable for a school's plasma TV.
It is written in Golang for backend and ReactJS for frontend.

Project was never finished, and has some issues that i'd not run into now.
For example, build tags for debug/release, logrus logging library and so on.

The project has an admin panel, built with MaterialUI for ReactJS.
